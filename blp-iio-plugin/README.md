# What's this?

This blp iio plugin folder was added for compilation purposes and is the work of DrSuperGood:
https://github.com/DrSuperGood/blp-iio-plugin

NEVER use the version in this repo for anything meaningful, instead use DrSuperGood's version, which I assume he will update.
I have my entire Eclipse workspace managed by git and accidentally re-uploaded DrSuperGood's code in this case,
but I am not the author and am less likely to keep it up to date.
